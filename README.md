# Windows Glulxe

Windows Glulxe is an interpreter for the [Glulx](https://eblong.com/zarf/glulx/) virtual machine, which is widely used to play interactive fiction (text adventure) games created with [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/). It is based on Andew Plotkin's [Glulxe](https://github.com/erkyrath/glulxe) VM reference interpreter, combined with my [Windows Glk](https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Glk/) library, which provides the user interface.
